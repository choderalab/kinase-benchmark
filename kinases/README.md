# Kinase structures

Starting protein structures organized by domain. The original PDB files went through PDBFixer to isolate a chain without ligand.

* abl/2HYY-pdbfixer.pdb: Abl domain bound to imatinib.
* abl/3UE4-pdbfixer.pdb: Abl domain bound to bosutinib. For record purposes, the script that generated this file is in utils/pdbfix3UE4.
